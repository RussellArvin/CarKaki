## Project Overview

CarKaki is built using the modern [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), implementing a robust, layered architecture that ensures scalability, type safety, and maintainable code. The application helps users locate available parking spaces, check parking rates, and navigate to their desired parking locations.

## System Architecture

Our application is built with a clear separation of concerns across five main layers:

1. **View Layer**
   - Built with Next.js for both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)
   - Responsive user interfaces for landing page, home page, and car park details
   - Enhanced SEO through server-side rendering

2. **Router Layer**
   - Implements tRPC for type-safe API routes
   - Efficient request handling between client and server
   - Streamlined API development without REST/GraphQL complexity

3. **Service Layer**
   - Handles core business logic
   - Modular design for easy maintenance and testing
   - Includes services for users, car parks, and parking history

4. **Repository Layer**
   - Manages database operations using Drizzle ORM
   - Type-safe database queries
   - Efficient connection pooling with Neon.tech

5. **Model Layer**
   - Implements immutable data structures
